Learning a language is not easy. We tend to take our ability to verbally communicate without misunderstandings for granted because it appears to be one that we are born with. After all, it is difficult to question the functioning of a system that is so deeply embedded in human society. However, language is as complex as it is crucial, hiding layers of syntactical intricacy, semantic nuance, and social stigma beneath its deceptively natural textual and phonetic interface. For instance, while reading this paragraph, are you consciously parsing each sentence for meaning or simply…”understanding” subconsciously?

Admittedly, the burdens associated with language education have been somewhat lightened due to the increased accessibility and connection presented by language education apps. The focus of apps like DuoLingo on translation, auditory perception, and vocabulary through reward systems makes for commercial success, possibly thanks to the feeling one has of making measurable progress. However, these apps often place less emphasis on correct pronunciation and their scale makes customizability and generalizability require major structural overhauls. [Studies](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09588221.2012.700315) have reported that users may benefit from pronunciation training through speech recognition.

Talk2Learn was created to bring accessibility and practicality to consumers. A configurable language education app, it employs speech recognition to correct pronunciation and hands-free navigation.
